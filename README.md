# Analyzing U.S. Domestic Flights
## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Introduction
Air travel has become an important part of our society today.  It brings people closer together and transports them to places both for business and for pleasure.  Air travel is the fastest form of commercial transportation that is available.  

For this class project, I performed exploratory data analysis on U.S. air travel data.  In particular, I focused on the dataset presented here in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays.  It is based on flight delay and cancellation data from the Department of Transportation (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics for 2015.
